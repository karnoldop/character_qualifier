# Character Qualifiers

My friend and I worked on a project for our Database Systems course. It is called the "Character Qualifiers," which bases off on Valorant agents and League of Legend summoners along with items and lores about each character. 
## Objective
We have created an interactive infographic that lets users select roles, which corresponds to certain characters.
Each agent's information will be displayed along with all the statistics that is shown for each map preferences and win rate.

You can also:
* View weapon statistics
* Look for certain information through the search Bootstrap
* __ADMIN ONLY__ use the SQL I/U/D operation to adjust tuples for any changes on the statistics

## Implementation Details
* __Integrated Development Environment (IDE):__ VSCode
* __Database:__ SQLite3
* __Frontend:__ HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* __Backend:__ Python, Flask
